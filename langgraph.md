# LangGraph Notes

A comprehensive guide and reference for LangGraph - a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.

## Overview

LangGraph is a library built on top of LangChain that enables you to build stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs using graph-based workflows.

## Key Concepts

### State
- Central concept in LangGraph
- Represents the current state of your application
- Can be shared and modified by different nodes in the graph

### Nodes
- Individual processing units in the graph
- Each node is a function that takes the current state and returns updates
- Can be simple functions or complex LLM chains

### Edges
- Define the flow between nodes
- Can be conditional (based on state) or unconditional
- Control the execution path through the graph

### Graph
- The overall workflow structure
- Combines nodes and edges to create a complete application flow

## Basic Example Structure

```python
from langgraph import StateGraph, END
from typing import TypedDict

# Define your state
class MyState(TypedDict):
    messages: list
    user_input: str
    result: str

# Create the graph
workflow = StateGraph(MyState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("process_input", process_input_node)
workflow.add_node("generate_response", generate_response_node)

# Add edges
workflow.add_edge("process_input", "generate_response")
workflow.add_edge("generate_response", END)

# Set entry point
workflow.set_entry_point("process_input")

# Compile the graph
app = workflow.compile()
```

## Common Patterns

### Conditional Routing
- Use conditional edges to route based on state
- Helpful for decision-making workflows

### Human-in-the-Loop
- Pause execution for human input
- Resume from where it left off

### Multi-Agent Workflows
- Different agents handling different parts of the workflow
- State sharing between agents

## Best Practices

1. **State Design**: Keep state minimal but sufficient
2. **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully in nodes
3. **Testing**: Test individual nodes before integrating
4. **Monitoring**: Add logging for debugging complex workflows
